REMOVE ALGO for Linear Probing

Probes the buckets until either the bucket is "Empty since start" or the # buckets probed >= # total

If bucket is empty since start, it stops probing because that means the element you want to remove does NOT exist

so the while condition is if its not emptysincestart and if bucketsProbed < N

the if inside the while is if the bucket is NOT empty and if the key at the bucket = the key searching for

mid-square hash - 

if key = 110
N = 200
R = 3

110*110 = 12100
R is middle 3 digits so R = 210
210 % 200 = 10
