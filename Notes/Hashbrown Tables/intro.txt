Stores items by mapping each item to a location in an array
May only require O(1) to search because you directly go to the bucke that the item is in

Key - value used to map an item to an index 

e.x for employees, it would be ID number since that is a unique classification

% 10 maps indices 0-9

Chaining - multiple values are stored in the same bucket

Open-addressing - a value that would be stored in the same bucket is stored in another one
(aka linear probing)
    if all buckets are filled, it loops back around to the first bucket
    only stops for empty-since-start buckets
