1) 
	
	Person A cannot be innocent due to contradiction.
	
	Suppose A is innocent. 
	That means that C is guilty from the first statement
	That also means that C is innocent from the second statement.
	Someone cannot be guilty and innocent at the same time.
	
	Therefore, by contradiction, A has to be guilty.

2) 	
	Since at least one of them have to be guilty, 
	
	C is one of them that has to be guilty, because if C is not guilty,
	there is the possibility that none of them are guilty which would be a contradiction
	to the first statement
	

	

3)
	
	If A and B, then C 
	If A	  , then B or C 
	If C      , then D 
	If not A  , then D
	
	D will be guilty regardless and everyone else is doubtful.
	
	Suppose A is guilty, that means that either B or C is guilty from (2). 
	We can then take two paths:
	Assume C is the guilty one, then D is automatically guilty from (3).
	Assume B is the guilty one, then from (1), C is guilty too which means D is guilty from (3).
	
	Suppose A is innocent, that means that D is guilty from (4). 
	
	So whatever happens, D will always be guilty, but it is impossible to determine who he will work with.
	
	
	
4)

	If A tells truth and B tells truth, there is a contradiction since A cannot be a knight and knave
	If A tells truth and B lies, there is a contradiction because a knight (B) cannot lie
	If A lies and B tells the truth, that could be true because B says A is a knave
	If both lie, that is a contradiction because that would mean they are both knaves, but
	if they are both knaves, B told the truth because he said A is a knave
	
	So, A is a knave, and B is a knight
	

5) 
	Both cannot tell the truth or else A would have to be a knight but B says that they are opposite types
	If A tells the truth and B lies, there would be a contradiction because B cannot be a knight and lie
	If B tells truth and A lies, there would be a contradiction b/c B would have to be a knight and A
	says B is a knight. So A would be telling the truth and lying at the same time
	
	So, they both are knaves.


6)

	Knight - truth
	Knave - lie
	Spy - either or
	
	There is one of each
	
	A - I am knight
	B - I am knave
	C - B is knight
	
	Assume B is a knight, that is a contradiction because then B would be lying
		B is either spy or knave
		
		Assume B is a knave, that would be a contradiction because he says he is a knave, but 
		knaves lie.
			
			B is a spy
	
	Assume C is knight, that is not possible because then B would be a knight, but B says he is 
	a knave, so B would be lying
		C is knave
	
	Assume A is knight. No contradiction
	
	So, 
	A - knight
	B - spy
	C - knave

7)
	A - C is knave
	B - A is knight
	C - C is spy
	
	Assume B is a knight
		That would be a contradiction because there cannot be 2 knights
	
	Assume A is a knight, 
		That would mean that B has to be a spy because B would be telling the truth
		C would have to be the knave since there is only one of each
	
	A - knight
	B - spy
	C - knave
	
8)
	A - A is knight
	B - A is knight
	C - C is spy
	
	Assume B is a knight, that would be a contradiction because he says A is the knight and 2 people
	cannot be the knight
		B is either spy or knave
	
	Assume A is the knight
		Then B would have to be a spy because he is not the knight but he is telling the truth.
		That would leave C to be the knave
	
	A - knight
	B - spy
	C - knave
	
9)
	We know that Mr. Cook is not a cook because of his initial statement. We also know he is 
	not a carpenter.
	Mr. Cook has to be the Sailor
	
	Now we have two professions left: Carpenter and Cook
	
	We know that the Mr. Carpenter cannot be a carpenter because of the initial statement
	So Mr. Carpenter is the Cook.
	
	This means that Mr. Sailer is the Carpenter
	

10) 

	TWO traitors: Jessica, Wellington, Halleck, Idaho
	
	Traitors will lie, Innocents will speak the truth
	
	
	J    - Says J is NOT the traitor
	W    - Says W is NOT the traitor
	G    - Says J OR W is the traitor
	D    - Says J OR G is the traitor
	
	possible combinations, each person can be paired with another once.
	so 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible duos
	
	J and W 
	J and G
	J and D
	W and G
	W and D
	G and D
	
	Assume J and W were traitors:
		J and W lied
		W and G told the truth
	(this could be a possibility)
	
	Assume J and G:
		J lied
		G could have told the truth because he said J OR W and J was assumed
		So in this case, J is the only one who lied
	(Therefore, this is an impossible duo)
	
	Assume J and D:
		Only J lied
		D could have been telling the truth
	(impossible duo)
	
	Asusme W and G:
		Only W lied
	(impossible duo)
	
	Assume W and D:
		Both lied
	(possibility)
	
	Assume G and D:
		G lied
		D could have told truth
	(impossible)
	
	So, the only two possible pairs would be (J and W) OR (W and D).
	Wellington is in each of these, so he can report Wellington
