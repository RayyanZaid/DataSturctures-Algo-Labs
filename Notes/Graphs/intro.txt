 adjacency list graph representation is a size of O(V + E)
 because each vertex appears once and each edge appears twice
 adjacency lists help can help represent a graph

 adjacency matrix is O(V^2)


 breadth-first search (BFS) is a traversal that visits a starting vertex, then all vertices of distance 1 from that vertex, then of distance 2, and so on, without revisiting a vertex.

Algorithm

BFS(startV) {
    Enqueue startV in frontierQueue
    Add startV to discoveredSet
 
    while ( frontierQueue is not empty ) {
       currentV = Dequeue from frontierQueue
       "Visit" currentV
       for each vertex adjV adjacent to currentV {
          if ( adjV is not in discoveredSet ) {
             Enqueue adjV in frontierQueue
             Add adjV to discoveredSet
          }
       }
    }
 }
