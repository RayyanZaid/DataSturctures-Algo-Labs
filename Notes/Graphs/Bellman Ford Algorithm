E = # of edges
V = # of vertices

In Bellman Ford, each edge is "relaxed" V-1 times.

After each iteration, a vertex's current distance and 
predecessor may not yet be the shortest path from the 
start vertex. The shortest path may propagate to only one 
vertex each iteration, requiring V-1 iterations to propagate 
from the start vertex to all other vertices.

So O(E(V-1)) or O(n^2)

maximum number of edges =   n(n-1)  /  2

so worst case is O(n^3) if complete graph

The runtime for the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm is O(VE). 
The outer loop (the main iterations) executes V-1 times. In each 
outer loop execution, the algorithm visits each vertex and follows 
the subset of edges to adjacent vertices, following a total of E 
edges across all loop executions.
