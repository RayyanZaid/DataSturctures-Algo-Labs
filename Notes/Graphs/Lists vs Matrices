Adjacency Lists - size of O(V+E) because each vertex appears once (the array of vertices) and each each edge appears twice (the lists of edges for each vertex)
However, time to search for an adjacent matrix is O(V) as a vertex's adjacency list has to be traversed to look for another vertex

Adjacency Matrix - size is O(V^2) because it is a square matrix that has V number rows and columns
Advantage is that the search for an adjacent vertex is just O(1) because you just need to check if the location in the matrix is a 1 or 0.
