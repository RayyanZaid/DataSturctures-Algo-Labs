heap is balanced because no path is larger than log n 

rotate a tree to balance

talk about AVL
red and black trees




TO REPLACE THE ROOT IN A B-TREE
the largest value in the rightmost child of the left subtree

1) Move 35 (root) down, 36 (replacement) up, delete 35, rebalance

when inserting, if the node becomes a full node, split the node


if leaf is full when inserting, you split (not the best method, see below for better method)
or you can preemptive split (every node that has 3 elements, we will split)

when splitting, promote the middle elemnt up (full node has 3 elements, so promote second node)



FOR FINAL:
learn one way to insert a node into a B-Tree




REMOVING

when deleting leaf:


finding candidate 
swap 
redistribute
