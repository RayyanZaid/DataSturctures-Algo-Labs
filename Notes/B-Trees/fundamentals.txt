If a node has N keys, it must have N+1 children
You can have children with a different number of nodes
Order - the maximum number of children a node can have
	ex. if order is 4, it can have 1-3 keys and up to 4 children
	children DEPEND on KEY of the parent
	if parent has 1 key, it MUST have 2 children
	
	
	2-3-4 tree node means you it can have 1,2, or 3 keys which means it can have 2-4 children
	

Insertion and Splitting

Split - done on every FULL node in a tree where you:
		1. move the middle key from the child node to the parent node
		2. split the children into separate nodes
	
Root node is split into 3 nodes while the rest of the internal nodes are split into 2
Inserting always happens into a non full leaf node. If leaf node is full, then split it (using preemptive split)


Removing and Rotation

Does not change height

Right rotation: Rotates rightmost element in left child to the root 
				Rotates the roots left element into the middle child
				
Left rotation: Rotates leftmost element in right child to the root 
			   Rotates the roots right element into the middle child
