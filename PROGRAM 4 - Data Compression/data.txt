Teaching Experience *
Briefly describe any past or current teaching experience. It is great to hear about any teaching in a professional/formal environment. We are also interested to hear about the less formal ways you help your peers in school, relatives, friends, etc. Any experience working with K-12 kids is great, like working at camps for kids, youth sports or programs, babysitting, etc.

My teaching experience began almost a decade before I started work at Kumon; it started with my older brother who was diagnosed with autism. Ever since 3rd grade, I have had to take on the role of an older brother by helping him both socially and mentally. His main problem was comprehending directions of any kind, so obviously as his mentor this was not the most pleasant situation to be in. However, by sitting with him through his homework and explaining concepts to him over the years, both my patience and the comprehensibility of my explanations substantially increased. Using my brother as inspiration, I applied to my first job at Kumon where I learned several more practical skills that helped me as a mentor (listed on my resume). One valuable lesson I learned from Kumon was that different people learn differently. After teaching my brother for so many years, I realized that I had a tendency to teach everyone the way I taught my brother. My dedicated effort to adapt my teaching style to the personalities of my students is something that bolstered my work experience. Having gained some experience at Kumon, I decided to pursue private tutoring as it gave me more freedom to teach in my style. It was from this that I learned my next important teaching lesson: a majority of a student’s success comes from the environment created at home. I noticed that the students that did better after my tutoring were the ones that had involved parents and an environment where studying and education was praised. Knowing this, I started to focus some of my tutoring time on creating structured study plans and encouraging parents to become more involved in their students’ study habits. Overall, my teaching experience has been a huge learning experience where I was able to gradually increase the number of people I impacted over the years.


Interest in Teaching *
Briefly share why you are interested in teaching K-12 students. There are many good reasons, so feel free to share what drives you.

My interest of teaching is mainly due to three reasons:
1) To help people like my brother (people who cannot understand concepts as fast)
2) Seeing how young students react when they understand something new 
3) The potential that I learn in the process as well

When applying to my job at Kumon, I only had the first reason in mind, but my work experience slowly changed that. Over the course of my time at Kumon, I realized that my day was made every Monday around 5:00PM when my students looked up at me with the biggest smile on their faces after understanding a new concept. The passion and excitement they got from learning something new is almost immeasurable, and it completely contrasted with how some of my friends view education (probably because their educational experience was not as fun). This sparked an epiphany in me: the more young students I could teach, the more I could inspire to develop a lifelong interest in learning. I also realized that the more and more I taught, the more my perspective on not just education, but also on communicating with people, broadened drastically. After a year at Kumon, the speed at which I understood things at school increased drastically. By teaching the fundamentals of math and comprehension, I improved in basic areas in math and reading, which ultimately allowed me to perform better at a higher level. Overall, these three reasons are what inspire me to teach and are major reasons why I would like to continue my journey.
